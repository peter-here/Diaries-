Record what happened and what I thought.


Seems many thoughts sprang up in my mind when I reading the article written by xiaolai. He came up with some viewpoints.

## Mini class, big community


He says in his post, most of the people don't suit doing big things( or great things), it's really true. When we describe a person who can't accomplish anything, we often use these Parallel sentences:

> ## Can't afford to lose.
> ## Can't afford to wait.
> ## Can't afford to win.

There's a strategy for ordinary guys, and it's pretty effectual in use for a long long time.
## Make the content for the inhabitants around you.
> Pretend you are a local broadcasting staion, television station, or any other sort of media, and then focus on what needs the vicinal residents are eagerly looking for, provide them the most hihg quality services you could.

so much for tonight
